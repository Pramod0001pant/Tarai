# APK Build Kit (Capacitor + React/Vite)
This kit turns your existing React/Vite PWA into an **Android APK** using Capacitor.

## Quick Start (Local Debug APK)

1) From your project root (where `package.json` lives), copy this folder's contents into your repo:
   - `scripts/create-cap-android.sh`
   - `.github/workflows/android.yml` (optional, for CI)

2) Run:
```bash
bash scripts/create-cap-android.sh
